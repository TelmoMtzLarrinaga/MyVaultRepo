## Why use Compose?

Simplified control, while trying to set up a Minikube cluster I ran into some 
issues that's why i decided to use Docker Compose as an alternative. Since the 
applications dockerfiles are already set up it takes less time to learn how 
to manage multi-container applications through a single YAML file. Additionally,
Compose its specially well suited for testing environments. Although Minikube
is also quite useful, i think docker better fits our needs here.
